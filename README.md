# Busy Bee Scheduler
Week 5 Project to build a work day scheduler, using jQuery, bootstrap, html, css, and JavaScript. It should take in an input and save it on the click of the save button, as well as change colours throughout the day depending no whether it is past, present or future. 

## What was used:
I used bootstrap, and jQuery plug-ins, with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I decided to add custom colouring to make it pretty, along with taking out certain borders, adding border-radius and coming up with a colour scheme that I like and would personally use more.

## Difficulties:
-I wasn't sure if the HTML portion itself was meant to be dyanmically created so I asked BCS, and they said that I could do it like this.
I had some difficulties with this on all parts it's different when your working with multiple different sections and need to do a certain thing with multiple parts, but I learned a lot and it was a challenge for sure. 

## What I learned:
What I learned from this project is how to use plug-ins and frameworks like bootstrap and how useful that it can be when it comes to building a project and the time that it saves. 

## Usage:
Select the coloured block by the time that you would like to schedule something in for, once completed select the save icon on the right hand side in the dark green box. 
To deleted something that is saved, delete the contents and select the save button again.
